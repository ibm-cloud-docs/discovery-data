A developer can use APIs, SDKs, and other tools that are provided with {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to enhance the capabilities of your project.

For more information about how to use custom user interface components that are available, see [Deploying your project](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-deploy).

A developer can make the following enhancements:

- Connect to a data source that isn't available by default by [creating a custom connector](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-build-connector).
- Apply special settings that control how documents are added to a collection by [building a crawler plug-in](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-crawler-plugin-build).

To use the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} API, you first need to [get your project ID](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-api-use).
