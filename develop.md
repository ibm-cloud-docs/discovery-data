A developer can use APIs, SDKs, and other tools that are provided with {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to enhance the capabilities of your project.

A developer can make the following enhancements:

- Process documents without storing them in a collection by [using the Analyze API](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-analyzeapi).
- Specify the exact document to return in response to a specific query with [curations](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-curations).
- Use API to [define more complex queries with the Discovery Query Language](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-dql-overview).
- Connect to a data source that isn't available by default by [creating a custom connector](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-build-connector).
- Apply special settings that control how documents are added to a collection by [building a crawler plug-in](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-crawler-plugin-build).

To use the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} API, you first need to [get your project ID](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-api-use).
