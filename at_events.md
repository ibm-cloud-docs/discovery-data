## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Navigating to the UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch){: external}.
