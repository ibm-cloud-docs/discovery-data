# Glossary
{: #glossary}

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Classifier | A resource that you can train to recognize document types and categorize them in your collection. You can create two types of classifiers, a *text classifier* and a *document classifier*. A *text classifier* can classify documents based on words and phrases that are extracted from the body text with their part of speech information taken into account. A *document classifier* can classify documents based on words and phrases that are extracted from the body text fields with information from their part of speech and the other enrichments that are applied to the body text taken into account. The information from the other nonbody fields are also used. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-cm-doc-classifier) |
| Collection | A set of documents that you can enrich and later search for meaningful information. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Content Intelligence | A feature that you can use to enrich documents in a Document Retrieval project such that the project can recognize information that is relevant to business contracts. A Document Retrieval project with this feature enabled is referred to as a *Document Retrieval for Contracts* project type. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects#doc-retrieval-contracts) |
| Data source | An external application or service where valuable knowledge resources are stored. Connect to a service where your data is stored so you can crawl the data without having to move it. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Domain-specific | Relates to terms and concepts that have special meaning to an industry or business. In tennis, for example, the term *love* has a special meaning. It represents a zero score. If you built a tennis-related application, you would teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} that the term *love* has a meaning in the domain of tennis that is different from the generally understood meaning. |
| Enrichment | What you add to documents in your collection to identify or *tag* terms in the document that are significant. For example, when you apply the Entity enrichment, terms that mention city names or famous people are tagged as locations or people of interest. |
| Facet | A category by which you can filter search query results. Automatically, facets based on entity types are applied to the query results for Document Retrieval projects and facets based on the parts of speech are applied to Content Mining projects. You can define your own facet categories based on document fields, including fields generated by enrichments, or based on dictionaries or patterns. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-facets) |
| Index | As you upload data or connect to data that is stored in an external repository, the data is crawled and ingested. As part of the processing, an index is created to keep track of important information that is recognized from the source. The main difference between a data source and a collection is that content in the data source is crawled, normalized, and indexed as it is added to a collection. |
| Project | A container for the collections of data that fuel your research or search applications. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects). |
| Regular expression | A regular expression, also known as a *regex*, is a standardized format for defining search patterns. You can define patterns with special significance to your application. For example, the bill of materials (BOM) numbers for parts that you manufacture might have a standard syntax of two uppercase letters followed by four numbers (`GT2345`). You can teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to recognize BOM mentions by adding a regular expression that can recognize and tag occurrences of the pattern in text. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-regex). |
| Stopword | Words to filter out of queries because they are not useful in a search, such as `a`, `an`, and `the`. You can add words that are common and not useful to your use case as stopwords to improve the relevance of results for natural language queries. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings#stopwords). |
