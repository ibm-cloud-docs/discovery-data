{: faq}

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Classifier | A resource that you can train to recognize document types and categorize them in your collection. You can create two types of classifiers, a *text classifier* and a *document classifier*. A *document classifier* can classify documents based on Part of Speech information and metadata that is added by other enrichments that are applied to the collection. You can create a document classifier from the deployed Content Mining application only. From all other project types, you can create a *text classifier*. A text classifier can classify documents based on Part of Speech information only. You can apply a document classifier that you create by using the deployed Content Mining application to categorize documents in other project types. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-contentminerapp#create-doc-classifier) |
| Collection | A set of documents that you can enrich and later search for meaningful information. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Content Intelligence | A feature that you can use to enrich documents in a Document Retrieval project such that it can recognize information that is relevant to business contracts. A Document Retrieval project with this feature enabled is referred to as a *Document Retrieval for Contracts* project type. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects#doc-retrieval-contracts) |
| Data source | An external application or service where valuable knowledge resources are stored. Connect to a service where your data is stored so you can crawl the data without having to move it. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Domain-specific | Relates to terms and concepts that have special meaning to an industry or business. In tennis, for example, the term *love* has a special meaning. It represents a zero score. If you built a tennis-related application, you would teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} that the term *love* has a meaning in the domain of tennis that is different from the generally understood meaning. |
| Enrichment | What you add to documents in your collection to identify or *tag* terms in the document that are significant. For example, when you apply the Entity enrichment, terms that mention city names or famous people are tagged as locations or people of interest. |
| Facet | A category by which you can filter search query results. Automatically, facets based on entity types are applied to the query results for Document Retrieval projects and facets based on the parts of speech are applied to Content Mining projects. You can define your own facet categories based on document fields, including fields generated by enrichments, or based on dictionaries or patterns. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-facets) |
| Index | As you upload data or connect to data that is stored in an external repository, the data is crawled and ingested. As part of the processing, an index is created to keep track of important information that is recognized from the source. The main difference between a data source and a collection is that content in the data source is crawled, normalized, and indexed as it is added to a collection. |
| Project | A container for the collections of data that fuel your research or search applications. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects). |
| Regular expression | A regular expression, also known as a *regex*, is a standardized format for defining search patterns. You can define patterns with special significance to your application. For example, the bill of materials (BOM) numbers for parts that you manufacture might have a standard syntax of two uppercase letters followed by four numbers (`GT2345`). You can teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to recognize BOM mentions by adding a regular expression that can recognize and tag occurrences of the pattern in text. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain#regex). |
| Stopword | Words to filter out of queries because they are not useful in a search, such as `a`, `an`, and `the`. You can add words that are common and not useful to your use case as stopwords to improve the relevance of results for natural language queries. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings#stopwords). |

## Can I integrate Watson Discovery with Watson Assistant?
{: #faq-integrate}
{: faq}

You can integrate {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} to make information that is stored in external data sources available to a virtual assistant. Create a *Conversational Search* project in {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}}, and then add the data sources that you want to make available to it. Next, create a *search skill* in {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, and connect it to your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} project and collection. For more information, see the [Help your chatbot answer frequently asked questions](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-tutorial-convo) tutorial.

## How does Watson Discovery access my data?
{: #faq-connectors}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} has built-in connectors that can crawl various data sources, including websites, IBM Cloud Object Storage, Box, Microsoft SharePoint, and Salesforce sites. It even has support for you to build custom connectors. You can schedule crawls so that as the source data changes, the latest version is picked up by your collection automatically. {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} only ever reads from external data sources; it never writes, updates, or deletes any content in the original data source. For more information, see [Creating collections](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections)

## Can I upload documents?
{: #faq-uploaddocs}
{: faq}

Yes, you can upload documents directly to a collection in your project. An upload is a one-time operation that you can use to get started. An alternative approach is to connect to a data source and crawl the source for information. When you crawl data sources, the data can stay where it is and you can set up a schedule by which to crawl the external source to find new and changed information. When you crawl the data, you know that the information in your collection is always up to date. For more information, see [Creating collections](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections).

## Must all my documents be English?
{: #faq-languages}
{: faq}

No. {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} support multiple languages. For more information about language support per feature, see [Language support](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).

## What types of files can Discovery ingest?
{: #faq-doctype}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} can ingest most standard business file types, including PDF, Microsoft Word documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. For a complete list, see [Supported file types](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections#supportedfiletypes).

## Can I customize Discovery to understand my data
{: #faq-customize}
{: faq}

Yes. Use the intuitive tools provided with the product to teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} about the unique terminology of your domain. For example, you can teach it to recognize patterns, such as BOM or part numbers that you use, or add dictionaries that recognize your product names and other industry-specific word meanings. For more information, see [Adding domain-specific resources](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain).

## How does the Smart Document Understanding tool work?
{: #faq-sdu}
{: faq}

You can use the Smart Document Understanding tool to teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} about sections in your documents with distinct format and structure that you want {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to index. You can define a new field, and then annotate documents to train {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to understand what type of information is typically stored in the field. For more information, see [Using Smart Document Understanding](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-configuring-fields).

## What's the best way to add synonyms?
{: #faq-synonyms}
{: faq}

You can use two different methods to define synonyms.

- To define synonyms that are recognized and tagged when a document is ingested and that can be retrieved by search, create a dictionary and add synonyms for the dictionary term entry. A dictionary defines special terms that you want to tag in your documents, such as product names or industry-specific terminology. You can use the dictionary terms later to create facets and to filter documents. For more information, see [Dictionary](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain#dictionary).
- To define synonyms that are applied to the query text that is submitted by users to expand the meaning of the query, add synonyms by using the Synonyms tool on the *Improve relevance* section of the *Improve and customize* page. For more information, see [Expanding the meaning of queries](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings#query-expansion).

## What is a nested field?
{: #faq-nested-fields}
{: faq}

When you ingest a file or crawl an external data source, the data that you add to {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} is processed and added to the collection as a document. Fields from the original file are converted to document fields and are added to the collection's index. Some content is added to root-level index fields and some information is stored in nested fields. Where data gets stored differs by file type. Most of the fields from structured data sources are stored as root-level fields. For files with unstructured data, much of the body of the file is stored in the `text` field in the index. Other information, such as the file name, is stored in nested fields with names like `extracted_metadata.filename`. You can determine whether a field is a nested field by its name. If the field name includes a period, it is a nested field. For more information about how different file types are handled, see [How your data source is processed](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-index-overview).

## Seeing errors that mention watsonplatform.net
{: #faq-watsonplatform}
{: faq}

Old API endpoint URLs that include `watsonplatform.net` are deprecated and were retired on 26 May 2021. If you see errors that mention `watsonplatform.net`, make sure your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service instance is using updated credentials. And, if you have any old credentials with the old endpoint URL listed in your service page, delete them. For more information about the deprecation, see [Updating endpoint URLs from watsonplatform.net](/docs/watson?topic=watson-endpoint-change).

## Getting a 401 error when using my Lite plan
{: #faq-lite-plan-deletion}
{: faq}

If you are seeing `401 invalid credentials` messages for a Lite plan that hasn't been used in a while, don't spend time creating new credentials. The error message is misleading. Any Lite plans with no activity for 120 days are deleted automatically. Unfortunately, the service instance deletion is not being reflected in IBM Cloud Resources list.
