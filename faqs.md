| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Classifier | A resource that you can train to recognize document types and categorize them in your collection. You can create two types of classifiers, a *text classifier* and a *document classifier*. A *document classifier* can classify documents based on Part of Speech information and metadata that is added by other enrichments that are applied to the collection. You can create a document classifier from the deployed Content Mining application only. From all other project types, you can create a *text classifier*. A text classifier can classify documents based on Part of Speech information only. You can apply a document classifier that you create by using the deployed Content Mining application to categorize documents in other project types. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-contentminerapp#create-doc-classifier) |
| Collection | A set of documents that you can enrich and later search for meaningful information. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Content Intelligence | A feature that you can use to enrich documents in a Document Retrieval project such that it can recognize information that is relevant to business contracts. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects#doc-retrieval-contracts) |
| Data source | An external application or service where valuable knowledge resources are stored. Connect to a service where your data is stored so you can crawl the data without having to move it. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections). |
| Domain-specific | Relates to terms and concepts that have special meaning to an industry or business. For example, the term *love* has a special meaning in tennis, by representing a zero score, that is different from how the term is used and understood generally. If you are building a tennis-related application, you must teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} that the term *love* has a special meaning in the domain of tennis. |
| Enrichment | What you add to documents in your collection to identify or *tag* terms in the document that are significant. For example, when you apply the Entity enrichment, terms that mention city names or famous people are tagged as locations or people of interest. |
| Facet | A category by which you can filter search query results. Automatically, facets based on entity types are applied to the query results for Document Retrieval projects and facets based on the parts of speech are applied to Content Mining projects. You can define your own facet categories based on document fields, including fields generated by enrichments, or based on dictionaries or patterns. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-facets) |
| Index | As you upload data or connect to data that is stored in an external repository, the data is crawled and ingested. As part of the processing, an index is created to keep track of important information that is recognized from the source. The main difference between a data source and a collection is that content in the collection is normalized and indexed. |
| Project | A container for the collections of data that fuel your research or search applications. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects). |
| Regular expression | A regular expression, also known as a *regex*, is a standardized format for defining search patterns. You can define patterns with special significance to your application. For example, the bill of materials (BOM) numbers for parts that you manufacture might have a standard syntax of two uppercase letters followed by four numbers (GT2345). You can teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to recognize BOM mentions by adding a regular expression that can recognize and tag occurrences of the pattern in text. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain#regex). |
| Stopword | Words to filter out of queries because they are not useful in a search, such as `a`, `an`, and `the`. You can add words that are common and not useful to your use case as stopwords to improve the relevance of results for natural language queries. [Learn more](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings#stopwords). |

## Can I integrate Watson Discovery with Watson Assistant?
{: #faq-integrate}
{: faq}

You can integrate {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} to make information that is stored in external data sources available to a virtual assistant. Create a *Conversational Search* project in {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}}, and then add the data sources that you want to make available to it. Next, create a *search skill* in {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, and connect it to your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} project and collection. For more information, see [Conversational Search](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects#conversational).

## Can I upload documents?
{: #faq-uploaddocs}
{: faq}

Yes, you can upload documents directly to a collection in your project. An upload is a one-time operation that you can use to get started. An alternative approach is to connect to a data source and crawl the source for information. When you crawl data sources, the data can stay where it is and you can set up a schedule by which to crawl the external source to find new and changed information. When you crawl the data, you know that the information in your collection is always up to date. For more information, see [Creating collections](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections).

## What types of files can Discovery ingest?
{: #faq-doctype}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} can ingest most standard business file types. For a complete list, see [Supported file types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-upload-data#supportedfiletypes).

## How does the Smart Document Understanding tool work?
{: #faq-sdu}
{: faq}

You can use the Smart Document Understanding tool to teach {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} about fields in your documents that you want {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to index. You can define a new field, and then annotate documents to train {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} to understand what type of information is typically stored in the field. For more information, see [Adding custom fields with Smart Document Understanding](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-configuring-fields).
