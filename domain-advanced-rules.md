# Advanced rules models
{: #domain-advanced-rules}

Add an advanced rules model to apply a text extraction model that was created and exported from the Advanced Rule editor of {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} to your collection.

Your model must be created with the appropriate {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} deployment:

- ![Cloud Pak for Data only](images/desktop.png) **{{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}}**: You can add models that were created with an instance of {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} that is hosted on {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- ![IBM Cloud only](images/ibm-cloud.png) **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**: You can add models that were created with a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} instance that is hosted on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} only.

{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} support for building models with the beta Advanced Rules Editor in instances that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ended on 30 June 2022. Any rules models that were exported from {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} before that date can continue to be run in {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}}.
{: note}

![IBM Cloud only](images/ibm-cloud.png) **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**: As an alternative to using a model that is generated by the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} Advanced Rules Editor, you can define a rule by [adding a Patterns enrichment](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-pattern).

To add an advanced rule model, complete the following steps:

1.  Create the model and export the ZIP file that contains the model resources from {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}}.

    For more information, see the following documentation:

    - [{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}}](/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-create-advanced-rules-model)
    - [{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-create-advanced-rules-model)

1.  From the *Teach domain concepts* section of the *Improvement tools* panel, choose **Advanced rules model**.
1.  Click **Upload**.

1.  Specify a name for the result field, which is the field in the index where the output of this enrichment will be stored.
1.  Click **Upload** to browse for the ZIP file that you exported earlier.
1.  Click **Create**.
1.  Choose the collection and field where you want to apply the enrichments from the model, and then click **Apply**.
