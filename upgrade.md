This information applies only to managed deployments. For more information about upgrading an installed deployment that is hosted by {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}}, see [Upgrading Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.0?topic=discovery-upgrading-watson){: external}.

## Upgrading your plan
{: #upgrade-plan}

You can explore the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} [service plan options](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery/pricing-2/){: external} to decide which plan is best for you.

The page header shows the plan you are using today.

![Shows that the Trial plan is displayed in the page header](images/plan-in-header.png)

You cannot upgrade from any v1 plan to any v2 plan. For example, you cannot upgrade a Lite or Advanced plan to a Plus plan. And you cannot upgrade an Advanced plan to a Premium (v2) plan. To start using v2, create a new Plus or Premium plan. For more information about the Lite and Advanced plans, see the [v1 pricing plans documentation](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-discovery-pricing-plans){: external}.

Even though you can use the Plus plan for the first 30 days at no charge, you must have a paid account to create a Plus plan. For more information about creating a paid account, see [Upgrading your account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account){: external}.

1.  How you upgrade depends on your plan.

    - If you decide you want to keep the Plus plan after using the 30-day free trial, no action is required.

      After 30 days of using the Plus plan at no cost, you are charged for it.

    - If you decide you do *not* want to continue using the Plus plan, delete the Plus plan service instance before the 30-day trial period ends. You can delete the service instance from the [IBM Cloud Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external}.

      The number of days that are left in your trial is displayed in the page header.

    - You cannot do an in-place upgrade from a Plus plan to a Premium plan.

      A Premium plan instance must be provisioned for you. To start the process, contact [Sales](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=MAIL-watson&disableCookie=Yes){: external}. You will be asked to provide the following details:

      - Customer name
      - Customer email
      - Planned deployment date
      - Data center location, such as Dallas or Frankfurt
      - Account ID
      - Resource group name
      - Resource group ID

        The resource group is created by the account holder. For more information, see [Assigning access to resources by using resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-access-getstarted&interface=ui).

For more information about plans, see [Discovery pricing plans](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-pricing-plans).
