In the 5.2.1 release, the bundled JVM for the crawler plug-in and customer connector features will be transitioned to IBM Semeru Runtimes, Version 21. If your crawler plug-in or custom connectors used in version 5.2.0 or earlier utilize any features that are incompatible between IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 and IBM Semeru Runtimes, Version 21, you need to revise your code to ensure compatibility with future releases, and re-deploy the built package for version 5.2.1.
