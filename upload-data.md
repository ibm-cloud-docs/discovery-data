# Uploading data
{: #upload-data}

You can perform a one-time document upload from your local file system at any time to add data to a project.
{: shortdesc}

You can upload up to 200 files at a time.

To process document sets that are larger than 200 files, add them to an external data source and use a data source crawler to upload them. For {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}} deployments, you can use a *Local File System* data source for this purpose.

For more information about the maximum size allowed for each file, see [Document limits](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections#collections-doc-limits).

Before you upload a CSV file to a Content Mining project, decide whether you want to apply enrichments to the content. If so, consider adding headers to the source file so that any fields that are generated have meaningful names. Without headers, fields are given generic names, such as `column_0`, `column_1`, and so on.
{: tip}

To upload data, complete the following steps:

1.  Open your project, go to the **Manage collections** page, and then click **New collection**.
1.  Choose **Upload data** as your data source, and then click **Next**.
1.  Name the collection.
1.  If the language of the documents in storage is not English, select the appropriate language.

    For a list of supported languages, see [Language support](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).
1.  ![IBM Cloud only](images/ibm-cloud.png) **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**: If you want to look for and extract question-and-answer pairs, select **Apply FAQ extraction**.

    For more information, see [FAQ extraction](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-sources#faq-extraction).
1.  Optionally, click **More processing settings** to expand the menu, and then click **Apply optical character recognition (OCR)**.

    By default, this option is set to **Off**. If you set it to **On**, {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} extracts text from images by using optical character recognition. The image quality must meet the minimum requirement of 75 DPI (dots per inch).

    When OCR is enabled and your documents contain images, processing takes longer.

1.  Click **Next**.
1.  Browse for the files you want to crawl.

    ![IBM Cloud only](images/ibm-cloud.png) **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**: You can drag documents that you want to add to your collection.

    For more information about supported file types, see [Supported file types](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections#supportedfiletypes).
1.  Click **Finish**.

The file upload is completed quickly. It takes more time for the data to be processed as it is added to the collection. After the files are uploaded and processed, the Activity page shows the upload results.

Unlike other data sources, you cannot schedule regular updates for uploaded files. If you want to add a later version of a file, you must delete the earlier version and rename the file before you upload it.

## How fields are handled
{: #field-name-limits}

When you upload a document, data in the file is indexed. For most unstructured file types, the bulk of the content from the file is added to a field named `text`. For files types that have an inherent data structure, such JSON files, names from the source file are used to name the fields in which the content is stored. When you upload files of this type, be aware of some naming limitations that exist for fields.

The following field names have special meaning. If possible avoid using these names in your structured source files.

- id
- document_id
- highlight
- html
- metadata
- result_metadata
- score
- spans

Field names that meet the following conditions are not queried:

- Start with the characters `_`, `+`, and `-`. For example, `+extracted-content`.
- Contain the characters `.`, `,`, `#`, `?`, or `:` or spaces. For example, `new:extracted-content`.
- End with numbers. For example, `extracted-content2`.

If you copy JSON that is generated by Discovery and then upload it as a JSON file, remove these system-generated fields from the file first: `document_id`, `parent_document_id`, `filename`, and `title`.
