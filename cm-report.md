# Creating a report
{: #cm-report}

If you discover insights as you analyze your data, you can save and share them with others by creating a report. A report consists of snapshots and notes about the analysis.
{: shortdesc}

## Take a snapshot
{: #cm-report-snap}

1.  Click the camera icon from the dashboard toolbar.

    You can also take a snapshot of the document preview. When you select one or more documents, only the selected documents are stored and displayed in the report. When no selection is made, all documents in the current page are stored and displayed in the report.
    {: note}

2.  Thumbnails of the snapshot are displayed in the *Report* pane, which is a temporary store for snapshots. 

    This store is cleared when the browser is refreshed or another collection is opened.
3.  From the menu icon of the snapshot's thumbnail, you can enter comments, or delete the snapshot. You can also edit comments later.
4.  Choose thumbnails that you want to add to a new report, and then click **Create**.
