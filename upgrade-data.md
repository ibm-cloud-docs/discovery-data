The steps to follow to upgrade your {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} service instance are described in the {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}} documentation. The following in-place upgrades are supported:

-   From a 4.0.x or 4.5.x release to a 4.6 release. For more information, see [Upgrading Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSQNUZ_4.6.x/svc-discovery/discovery-upgrade.html)
-   From a 4.0.x release or from one 4.5.x release to a later 4.5.y release. For more information, see [Upgrading Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSQNUZ_4.5.x/svc-discovery/discovery-upgrade.html){: external}.
-   From one 4.0.x release to a later 4.0.y release. For more information, see [Upgrading Watson Discovery to a newer 4.0 refresh](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSQNUZ_4.0/svc-discovery/discovery-upgrade-v4.html){: external}.

You cannot do an in-place upgrade from releases prior to version 4.x.
