# Understanding contract analysis
{: #contract_parsing}

The `Contracts` enrichment is available with the Document Retrieval for Contracts project type.
{: shortdesc}

When you analyze a document with the `Contracts` enrichment, the service returns the contract with an analysis of each identified element. The following sections describe how the returned JSON provides the analysis. For more information about the JSON output, see [Understanding the Contracts enrichment](/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-contracts-schema).

## Types
{: #cp_types}

The `types` array includes a number of objects, each of which contains `nature` and `party` keys whose values identify a couplet for the element.

The following tables list the possible values of the `nature` and `party` keys.

| `nature`         |Description                                                |
|:-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`Definition`      |This element adds clarity for a term, relationship, or similar. No action is required to fulfill the element, nor is any party affected.|
|`Disclaimer`      |The `party` in the element is not obligated to fulfill the terms specified by the element but is not prohibited from doing so.|
|`Exclusion`       |The `party` in the element will not fulfill the terms specified by the element.|
|`Obligation`      |The `party` in the element is required to fulfill the terms specified by the element.|
|`Right`           |The `party` in the element is guaranteed to receive the terms specified by the element.|
{: caption="Supported keys" caption-side="top"}

Each `nature` key is paired with a `party` key, which contains either the name or the role of the party or parties that apply to the nature (examples include, but are not limited to, `Buyer`, `IBM`, or `All Parties`). Note that for the `Definition` nature, the party is always `None`.

## Parties
{: #contract_parties}

The `parties` array specifies the participants that are listed in the contract. Each `party` object is associated with other objects that provide details about the party, including:

-   `role`: The party's role. Values are listed in the table that follows this list.
-   `importance`: The importance of the party. Possible values are `Primary` for a primary party and `Unknown` for a non-primary party.
-   `addresses`: An array that identifies addresses.
    -   `text`: An address.
    -   `location`: The location of the address as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.
-   `contacts`: An array that defines the names and roles of contacts that are identified in the input document.
    -   `name`: The name of a contact.
    -   `role`: The role of the contact.
-   `mentions`: n array of objects that identify mentions of the party.
    -   `text`: A string that lists the name of the party.
    -   `location`: The location of the mention as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.

The values of `role` that can be returned for contracts include, but are not limited to:

| `role`           |Description                                                |

|`End User`        |The party who will interact with the provided goods or services, explicitly distinguished from the `Buyer`.|
|`None`            |No party was identified for the element.|
|`Supplier`        |The party responsible for providing the goods or services listed in the contract.|
